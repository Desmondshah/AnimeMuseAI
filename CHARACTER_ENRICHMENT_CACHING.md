# Character AI Enrichment Caching Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds proper caching for AI character enrichment data to prevent losing enriched data when navigating back and forth between character detail pages.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Database Query for Character Data
- Added `getCharacterFromAnime` query in `convex/anime.ts`
- Fetches character data with AI enrichment from the database
- Ensures data persistence across navigation

### 2. Updated Character Detail Page
- Modified `CharacterDetailPage.tsx` to use database query
- Added `useQuery` to fetch latest character data
- Automatic state updates when database has newer enrichment data
- Enhanced debugging for tracking data flow

### 3. Updated Navigation System
- Enhanced `MainApp.tsx` to track `animeId` for character navigation
- Modified `navigateToCharacterDetail` to include animeId
- Updated `AnimeDetailPage.tsx` to pass animeId in character clicks
- Proper state management for character data with anime context

### 4. Enhanced Enrichment Flow
- Admin enrichment properly saves to database via `updateCharacterInAnime`
- Character state updates both locally and from database
- Automatic cache refresh after enrichment completion

## How it works:

1. **Character Selection**: When user clicks character, animeId is now tracked
2. **Data Loading**: CharacterDetailPage queries database for latest character data
3. **Enrichment**: Admin enrichment saves to database and updates local state
4. **Navigation**: When returning to character, latest data is fetched from database
5. **Cache Hit**: Enriched data persists and displays immediately

## Benefits:

- ✅ AI enrichment data persists across navigation
- ✅ No need to re-enrich characters when returning
- ✅ Automatic sync between database and UI state
- ✅ Proper admin protection flags are maintained
- ✅ Enhanced debugging for troubleshooting

## Testing:

1. Navigate to an anime detail page
2. Click on a character to view character detail
3. Use admin enrichment to enrich the character
4. Navigate back to anime detail
5. Click the same character again
6. Verify enriched data is still present (cached from database)

The system now properly caches and retrieves AI enrichment data, ensuring a seamless user experience.
