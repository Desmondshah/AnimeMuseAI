# Anime Deletion Protection System

## Problem
Anime that were deleted by admins were being automatically re-added by various automated systems:

1. **Auto-Refresh System** - Cron jobs that refresh anime data
2. **External API Integration** - Trending anime imports from AniList
3. **Smart Auto-Fill** - Batch anime creation from external IDs
4. **Missing Function Bug** - `checkAnimeExistsByExternalIds` was not implemented

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive deletion protection system that:

### 1. Deletion Protection Table
- Added `deletedAnimeProtection` table to track deleted anime
- Stores title, external IDs, deletion timestamp, and admin who deleted it
- Prevents re-adding through multiple matching criteria

### 2. Protection Checks
Updated all anime creation functions to check for deletion protection:
- `addAnimeInternal` - Internal anime creation
- `addAnimeByUserHandler` - User-initiated anime adding
- `fetchTrendingAnime` - Trending anime imports
- `batchSmartAutoFill` - Batch anime creation

### 3. Admin Management Functions
- `getDeletedAnimeProtectionList` - View protected anime list
- `removeAnimeFromDeletionProtection` - Allow re-adding specific anime
- `addAnimeToProtectionList` - Manually protect anime from creation

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Implemented missing `checkAnimeExistsByExternalIds` function
- Fixed existence checking logic in batch operations

## Usage

### For Admins
When you delete an anime, it's automatically added to the protection list. To manage the list:

1. **View Protected Anime:**
   ```typescript
   // Use the admin dashboard to view getDeletedAnimeProtectionList
   ```

2. **Allow Re-adding an Anime:**
   ```typescript
   // Use removeAnimeFromDeletionProtection with the protection ID
   ```

3. **Manually Protect an Anime:**
   ```typescript
   // Use addAnimeToProtectionList with title and reason
   ```

### For Developers
The protection system automatically prevents re-adding deleted anime across all automated systems. No manual intervention needed.

## Files Modified
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added deletedAnimeProtection table
- `convex/admin.ts` - Updated deletion logic and added management functions
- `convex/anime.ts` - Added protection checks and missing functions
- `convex/externalApis.ts` - Added protection checks to import functions

## Monitoring
- All protection actions are logged to console
- Failed attempts to re-add protected anime are logged with reasons
- Admin actions on the protection list are tracked

This system ensures that anime deleted by admins stay deleted unless explicitly allowed back by admin action.
